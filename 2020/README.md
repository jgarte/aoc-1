# [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)
> Solutions written in ANSI C (C89)

## Installation

Edit the [Makefile](./Makefile) to your satisfaction, and then run `make -r` to build all available solutions. You can build a particular day by specifying a number `make -r n`.

## Usage

Problem inputs are read from STDIN:

```sh
./n < input.txt
```

The solutions to both parts of the problem are then printed:

```
A) ... solution here ...
B) ... solution here ...
```
