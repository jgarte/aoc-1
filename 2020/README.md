# [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)
> Solutions written in ANSI C (C89)

## Installation

Edit the [Makefile](./Makefile) to your satisfaction, and then run `make -r` to build all available solutions. You can build a particular day by specifying a number `make -r n`.

## Day 1

Santa's expenses are read from STDIN:

```sh
./1 < input.txt
```

This will print the combinations which add to 2020:

```
A) 1404 * 616 = 864864
B) 857 * 483 * 680 = 281473080
```

## Day 2
